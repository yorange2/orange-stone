**Source of truth**: the `(simplified: ...)` doc comments on card consts in
`src/cards/classic_*.rs`. The Python side
(`orange-reinforcement/hearthstone_os/decks.py::_load_debt_ids`) extracts this set
by parsing those comments and excludes it from the RL training pool — so comment
wording changes ripple into the training pool (invalidate
`~/.cache/orange_stone_debt_ids.txt` after any edit here).

The 67 markers are 67 unique card IDs — the 3 pre-fix ID collisions
(Sword of Justice / Repentance / Lightwell) were resolved to their official IDs
(EX1_365 / EX1_349 / EX1_341), so Mass Dispel is now reachable. All 67 are in
`ALL_CARDS` (413 unique entries after the 10-card addition and the 7-entry dedup,
PR #77). 4 markers were stale comments on already-faithful cards and are cleaned
(§10); the genuine debt is 67 cards — **all 67 cleared (W0 13 + W1 11 +
W2 8 + W3 9 + W4 8 + W5 7 + W6 8 + W7 3); the ledger is EMPTY (2026-08-06
W7 wrap-up PR #86)**.

## The ledger (grouped by missing mechanism)

### 1. Enrage — damage-conditional buff (4) ✅ resolved (W0, PR #79)

All 4 wired to the existing `ThisMinionDamaged` trigger slot (registered per card
ID in `apply_card_keywords`, same pattern as Acolyte of Pain); the buff is a
permanent enchantment. Scenarios: `w0_gurubashi_berserker_enrage_permanent`,
`w0_tauren_warrior_enrage_with_taunt`, `w0_angry_chicken_enrage_fires_before_death`,
`w0_spiteful_smith_buffs_weapon_on_damage`.

### 2. Tribes — Beast / Murloc / Demon (9) ✅ resolved (W1, PR #80)

All landed: `CardDef.race` + race-conditioned targets/auras/triggers +
race-filtered deck draw + field-driven pools (`w1_*` scenarios; pool parity
pinned by `w1_race_pools_are_field_driven`). The F-A6-annotated Starving
Buzzard (HUNTER_013) and Scavenging Hyena (HUNTER_014) also left the ledger. 

### 3. Event triggers — summon / heal / death / secret / attack / play (2) ✅ resolved (W7, PR #86)

Alarm-o-Bot (hand-zone swap) landed in W7; Ethereal Arcanist (owns-secret
predicate) landed in W3 — this section is empty
(`w7_alarm_o_bot_swaps_with_hand_minion`).

### 4. Conditional targets & states (9) ✅ resolved (W3, PR #82)

All landed: attack-range (≤2 / ≥7), hand-size, hero-health threshold,
damaged-friendly/any targets, damaged-counting, owns-secret, the "first
minion this turn" state, and divine-shield absorb (`w3_*` scenarios).

### 5. Adjacent / multi-target (4) ✅ resolved (W5, PR #84)

All landed: adjacent-target Freeze (Cone of Cold), adjacent-target buffs
(Sunfury Protector Taunt / Ancient Mage Spell Damage), swap attack/health
(Crazed Alchemist) (`w5_*` scenarios).

### 6. Cost & weapon-condition auras (8) ✅ resolved (W4, PR #83)

All landed: hand-zone cost auras (global / own), weapon-attack cost reduction,
weapon-durability damage, weapon-equipped predicate (conditional Charge),
enemy-spells-cost-0, give-opponent-mana (`w4_*` scenarios).

### 7. This-turn temporary buff (1) ✅ resolved (W6, PR #85)

`GainStatsThisTurn` — the enchantment expires at the end of the turn
(`w6_mana_addict_buff_expires_at_turn_end`).

### 8. Probability (1) ✅ resolved (W6, PR #85)

`ChanceDraw` — a percentage draw at the end of the turn
(`w6_nat_pagle_chance_draw`).

### 9. Composite & miscellaneous (8) ✅ resolved (W5 PR #84 + W6 PR #85)

W5 cleared: Holy Wrath (draw-damage-by-cost), Ancestral Healing
(full-heal + Taunt). W6 cleared: Righteousness (mass Divine Shield), Ysera
Awakens (self-exclusion AOE), Lightwell (damaged-friendly start-of-turn
heal), Gift of the Wild (mass buff+Taunt), Pilfer (class-filtered draw —
verified already-faithful, stale comment cleaned). Scenarios `w5_*` / `w6_*`.

### 10. Resolved — marked simplified but already faithful (4, cleaned in PR #77)

Comments predated the implementing PRs (PR #72 Stealth for the first three;
Multi-Shot's `DealDamageToTwo` lands with the two-random-target effect). The defs
already carried the real effect; the stale "simplified" wording has been dropped,
which also removes them from the Python debt set (4 cards re-enter the RL pool).

| ID | Card | What was fixed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NEUTRAL_C10 | Jungle Panther | comment cleaned — `stealth: true` in def |
| NEUTRAL_T14 | Stranglethorn Tiger | comment cleaned — `stealth: true` in def |
| NEUTRAL_T15 | Ravenholdt Assassin | comment cleaned — `stealth: true` in def |
| HUNTER_012 | Multi-Shot | comment cleaned — `DealDamageToTwo` is the real effect |

## Findings from the 2026-08-06 audit pass (all resolved in PR #77 / PR #31)

These were F4 work items discovered while compiling the ledger. All structural
findings are resolved; what remains is the per-mechanism implementation work in the
groups above plus the F5 verification protocol.

- ✅ **F-A1 — 4 stale comments** (§10 above). Resolved: "(simplified…)" dropped from
  the comments; the Python extractor stops excluding the cards (cache invalidated);
  the RL pool gains 4 cards (3 stealth minions + Multi-Shot).
- ✅ **F-A2 — Worgen Infiltrator (NEUTRAL_C08)**: was still vanilla though Stealth
  exists. Resolved: hand-written def with `stealth: true`.
- ✅ **F-A3 — Card-ID collisions (3)**:
  - `SWORD_OF_JUSTICE` used `"PALADIN_017"` (= Holy Wrath) → now EX1_365
  - `REPENTANCE` used `"PALADIN_018"` (= Righteousness) → now EX1_349
  - `LIGHTWELL` used `"PRIEST_018"` (= Mass Dispel) → now EX1_341; **Mass Dispel is
    now reachable** (previously `card_by_id("PRIEST_018")` resolved to Lightwell).
- ✅ **F-A4 — 10 cards absent from `ALL_CARDS`** (Houndmaster, Tundra Rhino, Flare,
  Sword of Justice, Repentance, Blessing of Wisdom, Scavenging Hyena, Starving
  Buzzard, Eye for an Eye, Redemption). Resolved as *omission*: all 10 added to
  `ALL_CARDS` (413 unique entries). The RL pool is unaffected — the 6 simplified
  cards and the 4 newly-documented ones (F-A6) are all excluded by the debt set.
- ✅ **F-A5 — `ALL_CARDS` had 7 duplicated const entries** (410 entries, 403 unique).
  Resolved: deduped to 413 unique entries (403 + 10 additions).
- ✅ **F-A6 — Undocumented simplifications**: Starving Buzzard (HUNTER_013) and
  Scavenging Hyena (HUNTER_014) were tribe-simplified ("summon a minion" / "a
  friendly minion dies" vs. real "**Beast**") without a marker; Eye for an Eye and
  Redemption (PALADIN_020/021) are secret triggers with no effect wired. Resolved:
  all four now carry explicit `(simplified: …)` comments, so they are documented
  debt and stay out of the RL pool.
- ✅ **F-A7 — Python debt extractor was misattributing cards** (fixed in PR #31):
  `hearthstone_os/decks.py::_load_debt_ids` split the source on `pub const` blocks,
  so each `simplified` comment was matched to the *preceding* const's ID. The RL
  training pool therefore contained ~12 real simplified cards (Nat Pagle, Multi-Shot,
  Secretkeeper, Mass Dispel, Rampage, Cone of Cold, Ancestral Healing, …) and
  excluded ~15 clean ones; the 321-pool size was coincidental. Rewritten to resolve
  the comment to the const directly below it. Cache `~/.cache/orange_stone_debt_ids.txt`
  invalidated; M5's training numbers were produced on the pre-fix pool and will
  drift once re-trained.

## Mechanism inventory (what the engine has vs. what's missing)

**Exists** (so the corresponding cards are mostly *wiring* work):
`summon_trigger` / `spell_trigger` / `death_trigger` / `start|end_turn_effect` /
`aura` (`AuraTarget` incl. OtherFriendlyMinions) / cost-modifier stack (G5) /
`SilenceMinion`+`AllEnemyMinions` / `FreezeCharacter` / `FullHeal` / `DestroyMinion`
targets incl. `DamagedEnemyMinion` / `DealDamageToTwo` / `DestroyAdjacent` /
`GrantCharge` / Stealth / Elusive / Secrets / `ThisMinionDamaged` (Enrage —
W0 wired all 4) / Poison component (W0 — Emperor Cobra) /
`EffectTarget::EventSubject` + `OtherFriendlyMinion` (W0) / weapon triggers
register + destroyed weapons leave play (W0) / spell-cast deaths resolve before
"after you cast" triggers (W0) / `CardDef.race` + race-conditioned targets
(`FriendlyRace`/`AllOtherFriendlyRace`/`AnyRace`) + race-conditioned auras
(`GrantCharge` Charge aura) + `Trigger.race` + field-driven race pools (W1) /
trigger classes complete: `CharacterHealed`, `Attacked`, `CardPlayed`,
`SecretPlayed`, `MinionDied` (any) + destroy-secret effects (W2) /
hand-zone cost auras (`IncreaseMinionCost` / `IncreaseMinionCostFriendly`) +
weapon-attack cost reduction + weapon-durability damage + `ChargeWithWeapon`
conditional Charge + enemy-spells-cost-0 + give-opponent-mana (W4) /
set-health-to-1 (Repentance), swap attack/health (Crazed Alchemist),
adjacent-target buff/freeze (Sunfury Protector / Ancient Mage / Cone of Cold),
two-effect composition (Mass Dispel, Ancestral Healing) (W5).

**Missing** (primitives first, per the Review-II "do G before F4/F5" discipline):
1. effects: (none remaining — the W7 wrap-up needs hand-zone swap and two
   secret effects)

## F5 verification per fix

Every card that leaves this ledger must land with:
1. a scenario in `tests/differential.rs` pinning the exact real-HS sequencing
   (target sets, trigger timing, death-phase interplay), and
2. where the semantics can be mirrored, a deck-level parity check against
   SabberStone following `docs/differential_sabberstone.md`.

## Maintenance

- **Adding cards**: a new `(simplified …)` comment in `src/cards/` requires a row
  in this ledger (and vice versa). The RL training pool excludes this set
  (`hearthstone_os/decks.py`), so pool membership changes go through the ledger.
- **Fixing cards**: implement → F5 differential test → remove the ledger row →
  drop the code comment → invalidate `~/.cache/orange_stone_debt_ids.txt`
  (the Python extractor caches the parsed set).
- **Comment wording**: the Python extractor keys on the word "simplified" in the
  card's doc block. Use "simplified" only for genuine debt; use "(verified)" or
  plain text once faithful.
